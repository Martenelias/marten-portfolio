# My Portfolio 
Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my work as a web developer, featuring a responsive and modern design built with JavaScript and Sass. The design was carefully crafted using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/U61EAO7YAyEoVR1pXEde3d/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=WkuNWTgE1zZbqGPs-1).  

## Technologies Used 
***JavaScript:*** Provides interactivity and dynamic content throughout the site. 
***Sass:*** Used for styling with a focus on modularity and ease of maintenance. 
***HTML:*** The structure and backbone of the website. 
***Figma:*** The initial design and prototyping were done in Figma, allowing for a clean and consistent user interface. 
 
## Features 
***Responsive Design:*** The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on any device, from mobile phones to desktops. 
***Modern Aesthetics:*** Clean, minimalistic design with a focus on user experience. 
***Interactive Elements:*** JavaScript-driven features add interactivity to the portfolio, enhancing the user experience. 

## Design and Inspiration 
The portfolio design was created with a focus on showcasing my skills and projects in a visually appealing way. The use of Figma allowed me to iterate on the design and ensure that every detail was polished before development began.
